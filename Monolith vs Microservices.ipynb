    "A monolithic application is built as a single and indivisible unit. It is a default model for creating a software application. Usually, such a solution comprises a client-side user interface, a server side-application, and a database. It is unified and all the functions are managed and served in one place. Normally, monolithic applications have one large code base and lack modularity. If developers want to update or change something, they access the same code base. So, they make changes in the whole stack at once."

    "1. Simpler to develop\n",
    "As long as the monolithic approach is a standard way of building applications, any engineering team has the right knowledge and capabilities to develop a monolithic application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Easier to debug and test\n",
    "In contrast to the microservices architecture, monolithic applications are much easier to debug and test. Since a monolithic app is a single indivisible unit, you can run end-to-end testing much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Simpler to deploy\n",
    "Another advantage associated with the simplicity of monolithic apps is easier deployment. When it comes to monolithic applications, you do not have to handle many deployments â€“ just one file or directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Less cross-cutting concerns\n",
    "Cross-cutting concerns are the concerns that affect the whole application such as logging, handling, caching, and performance monitoring. In a monolithic application, this area of functionality concerns only one application so it is easier to handle it."

    "When a monolithic application scales up, it becomes too complicated to understand. Also, a complex system of code within one application is hard to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Harder to make changes\n",
    "It is harder to implement changes in such a large and complex application with highly tight coupling. Any code change affects the whole system so it has to be thoroughly coordinated. This makes the overall development process much longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Harder to add new technologies\n",

    "Split up into smaller and simpler components, a microservice application is easier to understand and manage. You just concentrate on a specific service that is related to a business goal you have.\n",

    "2. More agile\n",
    "All the services can be deployed and updated independently, which gives more flexibility. Secondly, a bug in one microservice has an impact only on a particular service and does not influence the entire application. Also, it is much easier to add new features to a microservice application than a monolithic one."
